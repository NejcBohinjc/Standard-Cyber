# Project Description

- The project is a web based platform that is suppose to help beginners in cybersecurity to get started in the field.
- This project is a project that me and my business partner are working on for our high school entrepreneurship club.

#### Special feature: a quiz that guides you into a certain cybersecurity path
- A special feature of the platform is a quiz that points you into a certain direction of cybersecurity
- There are a lot of paths that you can take in cybersecurity (e.g. cryptography, binary exploitation, osint, web, forensics, reverse engineering etc.). It's often hard for beginners to pick a field that they like and solely focus on that one specific field.
- This quiz makes it easier for beginners to focus on a single field, that is the most suited for them.
